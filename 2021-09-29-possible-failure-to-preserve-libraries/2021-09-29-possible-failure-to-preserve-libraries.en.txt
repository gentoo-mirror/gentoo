We have observed in some cases corruption of Portage's internal database
(VDB), where the libraries provided by a package are not recorded. This
can break the "preserve-libs" functionality, and thus in rare cases
break your system during much later updates (even if you do not use
"preseved-libs" now, but decide to switch it on later).

The underlying problem occurs usually when glibc has been upgraded to a
new major version, but pax-utils has not yet been upgraded to a version
compatible with it (but at that moment stays undetected).

The full technical details and investigation can be found on a Wiki page
[0] and on Bugzilla [1]. Changes have been made to prevent this happening
again both within Portage [7] (with possibly more to come [2]) and within the
glibc and pax-utils ebuilds [3][4].

To detect whether a system is affected, emerge the
app-portage/recover-broken-vdb package:
```
$ emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot app-portage/recover-broken-vdb
```
which provides two tools: recover-broken-vdb-find-broken.sh and
recover-broken-vdb.

Then run recover-broken-vdb-find-broken.sh:
```
$ recover-broken-vdb-find-broken.sh | tee broken_vdb_packages
```

This check should be run on all Gentoo systems. It is only necessary
to run this as a one-off, as changes have been made to prevent such
problems occurring in future.

If you have any output, read on.

Fixing a broken system is not always straightforward. It is strongly
recommended to take a backup of your full system before proceeding,
as well as a copy of /var/db/pkg (the VDB):

1. A tool has been developed [5] to attempt to fix the consistency
  of the Portage database. Using this tool to modify the VDB is NOT
  mandatory (read the full news item before proceeding) - you can skip
  to Step 2 if you wish, but fixing the integrity of the VDB
  makes it as safe as reasonably possible to proceed with
  rebuilding packages.

  Run:
  ```
  # Take a backup of /var/db/pkg before proceeding, such as by doing:
  $ cp -a /var/db/pkg /var/db/pkg.orig

  # And then:
  $ emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot --noreplace \
  	app-portage/recover-broken-vdb

  $ recover-broken-vdb

  # The tool will output to a random temporary directory.
  # Inspect the results, and then update the real /var/db/pkg/
  # by doing either:

  $ recover-broken-vdb --output /var/db/pkg

  # Or, manually copying the new files from the temporary directory tree
  # into your real /var/db/pkg/ directory tree.
  ```

2. Attempt to rebuild the affected packages, first upgrading
  app-portage/pax-utils to the latest version:
  ```
  $ emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot ">=app-misc/pax-utils-1.3.3"
  $ emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot --usepkg=n $(cat broken_vdb_packages)
  ```

Given that there are possible other side-effects of the corruption/bug,
it is strongly recommended that if any corruption is detected, all
packages on the system should be rebuilt, after following the above
steps:
```
$ emerge --ask --emptytree --usepkg=n @world
```

Note that binary packages may need to be discarded given they may
contain corrupt metadata.

Please see the wiki [0] for a full description of the background
of this problem and handling corner cases such as e.g. already
being affected by system breakage [6] as a result of the bug.
