            <unaffected range="ge">5.6.4-r1</unaffected>

    <background>
        <p>XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with a high compression ratio.</p>

    <description>
        <p>A use-after-free has been discovered in XZ utils. Please review the CVE identifier referenced below for details.</p>
    </description>
    <impact type="normal">
        <p>The multithreaded .xz decoder in liblzma has a bug where invalid input can at least result in a crash. The effects include heap use after free and writing to an address based on the null pointer plus an offset. Applications and libraries that use the lzma_stream_decoder_mt function are affected.

It&#39;s unlikely one can achieve more than a crash if xz is built with PIE on a 64-bit system especially, as is done in Gentoo by default.</p>
    </impact>
    <workaround>
        <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
    </workaround>
    <resolution>
        <p>All XZ utils users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
        
        <code>
          # emerge --sync
          # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/xz-utils-5.6.4-r1"
        </code>
