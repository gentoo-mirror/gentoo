The Gentoo/HPPA team has decided that the time invested in package
stabilization is no longer justified by the small number of users on the
Hewlett Packard Precision Architecture (hppa). In addition, Gentoo currently
lacks a working stable development machine.

As a result, all "hppa" keywords will be changed to "~hppa" on 2025-09-01,
with the "~hppa" keyword added to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS in the profile.

Users need not make any changes to their systems, and the Gentoo/HPPA team
does not currently plan to remove support for the architecture.
