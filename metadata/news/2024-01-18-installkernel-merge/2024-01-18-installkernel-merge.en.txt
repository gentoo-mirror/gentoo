The functionalities of sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo and
sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd have been merged into sys-kernel/installkernel.

sys-kernel/installkernel now provides the systemd USE flag to switch between
the traditional installkernel (formerly sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo) and
systemd's kernel-install (formerly sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd(-boot)).

Additionally, the new sys-kernel/installkernel with the systemd flag enabled
now provides a default install.conf configuration file which ensures that it
will work out-of-the-box with no configuration (other then USE flag
configuration) required for most setups.

Details on configuration and customization can be found on the installkernel
wiki page [1]. Below we provide the most important migration notes.


User Action Required (GRUB users)
====================

Previously sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo provided kernel installation
automation for users of GRUB via USE=grub. The new sys-kernel/installkernel
provides the same functionality, which now works with both the traditional
installkernel and systemd's kernel-install. In principle no user action is
required unless users wish to explicitly choose either the traditional
installkernel or systemd's kernel-install, in which case they may do so
via USE=-/+systemd.

sys-kernel/installkernel is renamed from sys-kernel/installkernel-gentoo,
therefore no user action is required to upgrade.


User Action Required (systemd-boot users)
====================

Previously sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd provided kernel installation
automation for users of systemd-boot. sys-kernel/installkernel provides
the same functionality but only via systemd's kernel-install. Users
of systemd-boot should therefore ensure that the systemd USE flag is enabled
when upgrading to >=sys-kernel/installkernel-14.

This upgrade path is enforced by sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd-4, which is
just a wrapper pulling in >=sys-kernel/installkernel-14 with the systemd flag
enabled. sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd may be removed after installing
>=sys-kernel/installkernel-14.

emerge --noreplace sys-kernel/installkernel
emerge --depclean sys-kernel/installkernel-systemd


User Action Required (users of other bootloaders and custom scripts)
====================

Users who have previously relied on custom installkernel or kernel-install
plugins should either ensure that the same kernel installation method will be
used after upgrading to >=sys-kernel/installkernel-14 (via USE=+/-systemd) or
migrate these custom plugins (details are on the wiki [1]).
