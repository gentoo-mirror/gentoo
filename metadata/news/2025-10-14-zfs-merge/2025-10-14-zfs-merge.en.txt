To simplify maintenance and system administration, sys-fs/zfs-kmod has been
merged into sys-fs/zfs starting from version 2.4.0_rc2-r1.

If you are using in-kernel modules from a custom built kernel you should
unset the modules USE flag for sys-fs/zfs to not build and install
kernel modules via sys-fs/zfs.

If you were using sys-fs/zfs-kmod and sys-fs/zfs before, you have not to
do anything special while upgrading as the package manager will take
care of deinstalling sys-fs/zfs-kmod before upgrading to the new
sys-fs/zfs version containing the modules.

If you experience a blocker, you may have to remove sys-fs/zfs-kmod from your
world file by running

  emerge --deselect sys-fs/zfs-kmod
