Dovecot-2.4 introduced breaking change to its entire configuration system and
Dovecot-2.3 configuration files will NOT work after upgrade. Please read

https://doc.dovecot.org/2.4.1/installation/upgrade/2.3-to-2.4.html

before upgrading. We strongly recommend finalizing your Dovecot 2.4
configuration on a test system before upgrading any production systems.

The following steps typically make the upgrade process easier:

1. Make a note of your current configuration by running doveconf -n
2. Stop the dovecot daemon
3. Move ALL your configuration files to a temporary location
4. Upgrade to dovecot-2.4.x
5. Read the new configuration files and uncomment as necessary
6. Compare the new doveconf -n output with the old one and add missing
configuration settings one by one while checking that the system works after
each change
