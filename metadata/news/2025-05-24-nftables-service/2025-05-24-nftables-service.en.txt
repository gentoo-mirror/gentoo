net-firewall/nftables-1.1.1-r1 made some changes to the provided systemd
units.

Prior to this version, nftables-restore.service was responsible for both
loading rules on system startup and for saving them on system shutdown.

The service has now been split in two:

nftables-load.service is responsible for loading rules at startup. Users
who relied on nftables-restore.service to load firewall rules must now
enable nftables-load.service instead.

nftables-store.service may be used to save the current ruleset by
starting it at any time. It may also be enabled to store the ruleset at
shutdown. Use of this service is not mandatory if the user chooses to
maintain the saved ruleset manually.
