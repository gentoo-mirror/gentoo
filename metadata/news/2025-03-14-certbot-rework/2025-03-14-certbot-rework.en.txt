Certbot and its modules have been reworked into a single package; this
should ease maintenance and make delivery faster and more reliable.

Starting from app-crypt/certbot-3.2.0-r100, only this package is
necessary to install Certbot and its modules thanks to the help of USE
flags. Some block statements are enforced for modules packages to avoid
collisions.
However actions from users are required: @world set and package.use
changes.

Temporary transition metapackages call for the appropriate USE flags,
but users still have to change their package.use and later they must
update their @world set to complete the transition before 2025-06-10
(around three months from publication), after which these temporary
transition packages will be removed.

As a reminder, there is a Wiki page for Certbot:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt

Step by step:

1. In /etc/portage/package.use:

Add an entry for the modules of your choice based on the USE flags of
the new unified package.  Example:

    app-crypt/certbot	certbot-apache certbot-dns-rfc2136

If you wish to stick with stable you may stop here.  The below steps
(skipping step 2) will be completed later once the unified package
stabilizes.  Should you wish to complete the transition now:

2. In /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords: (skip this step and continue
with step 3 if completing after the unified package stabilizes):

Add a keyword entry for the new unified package.  Example:

     ~app-crypt/certbot-3.2.0	~amd64

3. Clean the old module packages out of your @world or other sets:

    emerge --ask --deselect app-crypt/acme app-crypt/certbot-apache \
        app-crypt/certbot-dns-cloudflare app-crypt/certbot-dns-desec \
        app-crypt/certbot-dns-dnsimple app-crypt/certbot-dns-nsone \
        app-crypt/certbot-dns-rfc2136 app-crypt/certbot-nginx

4. Emerge or update app-crypt/certbot if necessary. This should remove
previous packages:

    emerge --verbose --ask --changed-use --noreplace app-crypt/certbot
