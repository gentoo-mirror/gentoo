The Gentoo/SPARC team has decided that the time invested in package
stabilization is no longer justified by the small number of users on the
SPARC architecture. In addition, Gentoo currently lacks a working stable
development machine.

As a result, all "sparc" keywords will be changed to "~sparc" on 2025-09-01,
with the "~sparc" keyword added to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS in the profile.

Users need not make any changes to their systems, and the Gentoo/SPARC team
does not currently plan to remove support for the architecture.
