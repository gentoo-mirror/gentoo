		This is a handy tool for generating terse netmasks in several common
		formats. If you've ever maintained a firewall with more than a few rules in
		it, you might use netmask to clean up and generalize sloppy rules left by
		the netadmin before you. It will also convert netmasks from one format to
		another for the day you change your firewall software.
