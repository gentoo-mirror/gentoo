NGINX is a web server and a reverse proxy. Following a year-long effort, its
packaging in Gentoo has undergone a major revamp[1]. Starting from the mainline
version 1.29.0 the changes will come into force.

On 2025-09-05, the stable version will also have the changes
described below in the "What changed?" section. This enables more thorough
testing before user-facing changes are applied to the stable NGINX version.

If you are reading this NEWS item, the information below is relevant for you.

What changed?
====================

There are a few user-facing changes with the updated packaging.

1. Third-party modules.

Third-party modules, which were previously part of the NGINX package,
www-servers/nginx, are now separate packages in the www-nginx/ category. The
Lua, Brotli, headers-more and upload-progress are examples of the modules that
are now separate packages. Some of the modules have been removed completely.

The following is a list of modules that have been removed. If you rely
on any of the modules outlined below, please file a bug on Gentoo
Bugzilla[2][3] asking the module to be added. The recommended summary
for a bug is "www-servers/nginx: please add module MODULE_NAME", where
MODULE_NAME is the name of the module you would like to see added.

Removed modules:
    - ngx_cache_purge/http_cache_purge_module
    - nginx_ngx_slowfs_cache/http_slowfs_cache_module
    - ngx_http_auth_pam_module/http_authpam_module
    - nginx_upstream_check_module/http_upstream_check_module
    - ngx_metrics/http_metrics_module
    - naxsi/http_naxsi_module
    - nginx-rtmp-module/rtmp_module
    - nginx-push-stream-module/http_push_stream_module
    - nginx-sticky-module-ng/http_sticky_module
    - nginx-mogilefs-module/http_mogilefs_module
    - nginx-auth-ldap/http_auth_ldap_module

2. USE flags.

Some USE flags, like "http-cache", "ktls", "pcre", "pcre-jit" and so on,
have been removed. They did not have any effect or served no purpose,
thus you need not worry about them.

The "http2", "http3" use flags have been renamed to
nginx_modules_http_v2 and nginx_modules_http_v3 respectively. They
correspond to NGINX_MODULES_HTTP "v2" and "v3" USE_EXPAND flags
accordingly. "ssl" use flag has been changed into individual "ssl"
USE_EXPAND flags for the mail, stream and HTTP servers.

Thread pool support[4], previously toggled by the "threads" USE flag, is
now enabled unconditionally. Vim syntax files are now provided by the
main www-servers/nginx package, instead of app-vim/nginx-syntax.

3. Default log files.

Default log filenames are now error.log and access.log, instead of
error_log and access_log.

User Action Required
====================

To upgrade to the new NGINX version, use the following command.

        emerge --deselect app-vim/nginx-syntax
        emerge --oneshot --update --deep www-servers/nginx

If you use any third-party modules, install the new separate package.
For instance, if you previously enabled the nginx_modules_http_lua USE
flag on www-servers/nginx, here is how you install the new Lua module
package.

        emerge www-nginx/ngx-lua-module

To list all the available module packages, use

        emerge --search @www-nginx | less

or

        qlist --installed --tree www-nginx/

If you use the "http2" or "http3" USE flags, enable the corresponding
USE_EXPAND flags. To enable http2 only:

        echo 'www-servers/nginx NGINX_MODULES_HTTP: v2' >> \
            /etc/portage/package.use/nginx.use

To enable http3:

        echo 'www-servers/nginx NGINX_MODULES_HTTP: v3' >> \
            /etc/portage/package.use/nginx.use

To enable both http2 and http3:

        echo 'www-servers/nginx NGINX_MODULES_HTTP: v2 v3' >> \
            /etc/portage/package.use/nginx.use

SSL/TLS modules are enabled by default. If you wish to disable them, use
the following command.

        echo www-servers/nginx NGINX_MODULES_HTTP: -ssl \
            NGINX_MODULES_STREAM: -ssl \
            NGINX_MODULES_MAIL: -ssl >> \
            /etc/portage/package.use/nginx.use

The updated NGINX comes with a new logrotate file that points to the new
log filenames. If any of your scripts rely on the old log files, change
them accordingly as needed.
