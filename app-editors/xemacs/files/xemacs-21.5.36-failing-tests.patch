Mark failing coding cookie test with Implementation-Incomplete-Expect-Errors, avoid fontconfig error with test and non-xft builds.

tests/ChangeLog addition:

2025-06-19  Aidan Kehoe  <kehoea@parhasard.net>

	* automated/mule-tests.el:
	Mark the tests of coding cookies on the last page with
	Implementation-Incomplete-Expect-Errors, since the code that does
	that implementation is currently surrounded by #if 0. Thank you
	Mats Lidell.

lisp/ChangeLog addition:

2025-06-19  Aidan Kehoe  <kehoea@parhasard.net>

	* fontconfig.el:
	Inappropriate to just (require 'font-mgr) here, since that
	routinely loads font-mgr.el which just errors when any of the
	relevant functions are called at run time.
	Wrap this call with (eval-when (:compile-toplevel) ...), document
	that doing this fixes needless test failure in face-tests.el.
