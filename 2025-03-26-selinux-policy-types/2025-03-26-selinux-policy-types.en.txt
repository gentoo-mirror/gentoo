In line with our wiki recommendations, the default SELINUXTYPE set in
/etc/selinux/config is now the mcs policy type. Hence, POLICY_TYPES
has been updated to build all policy types by default if none are
selected in make.conf.

If a user does not explicitly have an override set for POLICY_TYPES,
a full rebuild of selinux policy packages will be required:

emerge --ask --oneshot @selinux-rebuild
