  <longdescription>
    dqlite is a C library that implements an embeddable and replicated SQL 
    database engine with high-availability and automatic failover.

    The acronym "dqlite" stands for "distributed SQLite", meaning that dqlite 
    extends SQLite with a network protocol that can connect together various 
    instances of your application and have them act as a highly-available 
    cluster, with no dependency on external databases.
