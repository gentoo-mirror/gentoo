Due to increasing maintenance costs and complexities, Gentoo is going to
stop providing the cache-enabled git syncing mirrors found in the
gentoo-mirror GitHub organization [1], and CI services for third-party
repositories. We will continue providing mirrors for a curated set of
official repositories, including ::gentoo, ::guru, ::kde, and ::science.
The remaining mirrors will be removed on 2025-10-30.

Users who have previously added repositories using
<app-eselect/eselect-repository-15 may need to re-add these repositories
with >=app-eselect/eselect-repository-15, in order to update their sync
URIs.  For example, the following can be used:

	eselect repository remove ${repository}
	eselect repository enable ${repository}

Once the mirrors are discontinued, we are going to remove them entirely
in order to trigger sync errors for the remaining users, and ensure
that they are not stuck on non-updated mirrors.

This change does not affect users who have not used eselect-repository
or the gentoo-mirror repositories.  It does not affect the availability
of these repositories via >=app-eselect/eselect-repository-15
and repositories.xml -- the official upstream sync URI will be used
instead.
