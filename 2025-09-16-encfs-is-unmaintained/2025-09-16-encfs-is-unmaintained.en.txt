sys-fs/encfs is effectively unmaintained upstream.  Old archives are already
hard to read without it crashing [1], and no new bugfixes are expected.
Chances are data will become unreadable sooner than later.

Upstream recommends migrating to newer alternatives, like
app-crypt/gocryptfs [2].

Since migrating large quantities of data can take time, please consider
migrating everything while it's still possible.

Note: app-crypt/gocryptfs is better than encfs when used with local
storage, but it may be extremly slow over sshfs or CIFS [3].  A faster
alternative in such a case would be gocryptfs over rclone mount, or
using rclone crypt directly.
