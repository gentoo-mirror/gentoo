  <longdescription>
    The GNU Project distributes most of its manuals in the Info format.
    There are two primary Info readers: The stand-alone info program
    in <pkg>sys-apps/texinfo</pkg> and the info package in GNU Emacs
    <pkg>app-editors/emacs</pkg>.

    This manual describes how to get around inside of Info, various
    advanced Info commands, and contains references to other sources,
    which explain how to generate Info files from Texinfo files.
    It is provided as a separate package because the Texinfo package
    does not install it (as it is bundled with GNU Emacs), but the
    stand-alone Info reader refers to it.
