net-mail/dovecot-2.4.2 will be stabilized soon[1] and will be the first
dovecot-2.4 release that will be stable in Gentoo.

Dovecot-2.3 configuration settings will not work with Dovecot-2.4 and
manual intervention is required for the upgrade. Please read

https://doc.dovecot.org/2.4.2/installation/upgrade/overview.html

before upgrading your dovecot instance.

We strongly recommend finalizing your Dovecot 2.4 configuration on a
test system before upgrading any production systems.

The following steps typically make the upgrade process easier:

1. Make a note of your current configuration by running doveconf -n
2. Stop the dovecot daemon
3. Move ALL your configuration files to a temporary location
4. Upgrade to dovecot-2.4.2
5. Read the new configuration files and uncomment as necessary
6. Compare the new doveconf -n output with the old one and add missing
configuration settings one by one while checking that the system works after
each change
